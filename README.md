# BDB_Internship_Projects
These are projects completed during my internship with the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.

The 59 Billionaires of Palm Beach County Poster was extremely fun to make. From beginning to end, I used data collection, data management with Postgre SQL, data manipulation and cleaning with Postgre SQL and Excel, creating visualizations with PowerBI, Image editing using the Pillow imaging library in Python, and creating the poster with Canva. I have provided the python notebook containing the Pillow code used to edit the images, The PDF listing sources used in the poster, the PowerBI workbook for the visualizations, and the poster PDF itself.

Enjoy!
