# BDB_internship_MiniProjects
These are projects completed during my internship with the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.

The 59 Billionaires of Palm Beach County Poster was extremely fun to make. From beginning to end, I used data collection, data management with Postgre SQL, data manipulation and cleaning with Postgre SQL and Excel, creating visualizations with PowerBI, editing images using the Pillow imaging library in Python, and creating the poster with Canva. The sources of the data, spotlights, and pictures are included in another file.

Enjoy!
